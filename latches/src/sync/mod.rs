/// A latch is a downward counter which can be used to synchronize threads. The
/// value of the counter is initialized on creation. Threads may block on the
/// latch until the counter is decremented to 0.
///
/// In contrast to [`Barrier`], it is a one-shot phenomenon, that mean the
/// counter will not be reset after reaching 0. However, it has a useful
/// property in that it does not make threads wait for the counter to reach 0
/// by calling [`count_down()`] or [`arrive()`].
///
/// It spins before locking wait.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Created by `1` can be used as a simple gate, all threads calling [`wait()`]
/// will be blocked until a thread calls [`count_down()`].
///
/// Created by `N` can be used to make one or more threads wait until `N`
/// operations have completed, or an operation has completed 'N' times.
